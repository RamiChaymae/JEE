This application is based on a set of modern technologies, including Java, the Spring Framework, Hibernate, MySQL, and Thymeleaf for the creation of dynamic user interfaces. It allows users to view, add, modify and delete items, while displaying detailed lists with relevant information, with user role management. Each role has a specific set of permissions to access pages and perform corresponding operations. Spring Security is used to manage user authentication and authorisation.
